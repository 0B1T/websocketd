Release scripts for websocketd
==============================

Perform a fully automated repeateable release of websocketd. Including:

*   Downloading the correct version of Go
*   Cross-compiling Go for all required platforms
*   Cross-compiling websocketd for all required platforms
*   [TODO] Packaging installation files for all platforms
*   [TODO] Uploading releases to http://download.websocketd.com/

The installation should run on a stock Ubuntu installation - it will download any
additional tools it needs. The first run will be slow as it has to cross-compile
Go, but subsequent builds are incremental.

To build the packages for all platforms:

    make

[TODO] To release to http://download.websocketd.com/ as version 1.2.3.4

    make release version=1.2.3.4

To clean up:

    make clean
